# WarframeAlerts

This JavaFX app gets informations about events in Warframe from https://deathsnacks.com/wf/ and looks for info about event's prizes on http://warframe.wikia.com/wiki (in process of searching it sometimes uses https://www.ecosia.org/ search engine). Thanks to that user doesn't have to look for info about prize on his/her own.

I am not owner of sites mentioned above. I am grateful to their creators for making such contribution to Warframe fanbase. 
This project doesn't mean to exploit their work, it's just an app made by fellow Tenno for personal usage.
